# Car-Rental-System

🚗 Project Overview:

The Car Rental System is a Java-based console application that demonstrates an efficient and modular implementation of car rental operations using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The system enables users to rent cars, return cars, and manage rental transactions. It organizes the application's functionality into distinct classes, each representing a key entity in the system, such as Car, Customer, Rental, and CarRentalSystem.
